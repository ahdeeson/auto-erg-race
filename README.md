## Auto ErgRace

This program was made to make setting up and running indoor rowing competitions simpler. It automaticlly creates all the .rac2 files needed for your competiton. the program just needs the link to the race on regatta central to generate the files.

# Use

To use you will need to download the repository and navigate to dist/ergRaceMaker folder. Run the file ergRacer.exe, this will open a terminal window which will prompt you for the link to the regatta (It is important that you enter the link to the main overview page on regatta central). Once you hit enter a new window will open where you will chose the folder you want to save the completed files to (if ErgRace is already installed it's Races folder is recommened but not necessary). Once selected the terminal window will start logging all the files that are made.
